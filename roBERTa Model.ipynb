    "BPE (Byte-Pair Econding) tokenizer has a vocabulary that consists of single letters and sets of letters. When we create a vocabulary for this tokenizer, we start with all the letters as tokens and we merge tokens whose juxtaposition is frequent on the data set. However, if we consider UTF-8 charecters, the dictionary might get too big. To optimize our tokenizer, instead of working with letters as tokens, we use bytes as tokens.\n",
